These techniques have revolutionized how I do data science, and I hope they do the same for you.\n\nReal data science involves an element of exploration. I hope you find an interesting dataset to try these techniques on (Kaggle has a lot of [free datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) to try out).
